# torretest
This project was a search bar used to find the best candidates for a position filtered by skills weight, using React-Redux for the frontend  was used MaterialUI components and consuming the Torre API with 'axios' package, for me it was a challenge I couldn't overcome in one day, I was using a framework I'm not used to. But being honest I learned a lot from this test, the truth is I haven't code in a frecuently basis almost a year ago, of course before applying to this position I started to practicing again, but it wasn't enough to bring to life a working solution, I consider my self a fast learner and I'm getting back on track into  software development so I would apeal to you to give me a chance to prove my self if its necesary, again thanks for having me!
